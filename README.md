# Logik
Logik is an easy-to-use and user-friendly **logic circuit simulator**.
It is suitable not only for creating circuit prototypes, but also for use in education.

## Tutorial
For a hands-on tutorial and a quick reference, see:

- [the Czech documentation](https://j-jzk.cz/cs/projekty/logik)

## Development status
The program is not under active development, but it is very much functional (it works on my machine :)). I use it sometimes for school.

The internal code however leaves a lot to be desired and a large part of it would probably need to be rewritten if a bigger upgrade is needed.
